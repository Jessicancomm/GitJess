# Keyboards and UX

So, let's talk keyboards. Way back in the day, before smartphones and touchscreens, there were physical buttons on mobile devices. Unlike the digital keyboard that pop up and down when you need them, these devices had actual buttons that clicked under your fingers when you pressed them.&#x20;

Without a touch screen, the keyboard combinations were incredibly important. The user had to do perform all functions via those keyboard combinations. Stop for a second and imagine using your smartphone without being able to tap the screen.

It was my job to document the keyboards and the keyboard combinations. After speaking with people in the Quality Assurance and Support departments over time, I realized that the keyboards and their combinations were the most important content in the user documentation.&#x20;

### The Challenge

No one saw the keyboards assembled the way a user would until the first sample devices were manufactured. At this point in the process, making any changes or corrections cost more money and time than was feasible. The device was often close to being released.&#x20;

As far as the documentation process, I would receive a 10 to 12 page table from the Engineering department, reformat it, and publish. This did not seem like the best way to present such important information, but it was the way it was always done.

### My Solution

To my mind, we had to see the assembled keyboards before is was manufactured for the first time. I was having so much trouble figuring out the tables from Engineering (which sometimes arrived as text files with comma separated values), that I needed to see the keyboards myself just to check my own work.

Believing that there must be an assembled drawing of the keyboards somewhere, I went hunting and pecking through the engineering drawings on the shared drive. The documents in this drive were PDFs with names assigned by the coding system; in other words, not descriptive. Therefore, I had to open each PDF file to see what it contained.&#x20;

Eventually, I found all the keyboard drawings for each keyboard type. Most product lines offered at least two different keyboard. As it turned out, there were at least five or six separate drawings for each keyboard offered that were layered on top of each other.&#x20;

#### Assembling the Keyboards

I assembled the keyboards by reverse engineering the PDFs of the keyboard drawings in Adobe Illustrator. I layered each keyboard drawing on top of each other, aligned them, and then arranged the layers until they appeared as they would to a user.&#x20;
