# Keyboards

So, let's talk keyboards. Way back in the day, there were physical buttons on mobile devices. Unlike the digital keyboard that pop up and down when you need them, these devices had actual buttons that made a satisfying click or pop noises like a needle on a vinyl record.&#x20;

Without a touch screen, these keyboards had to do everything. And I had to document those keyboards and, more importantly, the keyboard combinations for the user.&#x20;

Stop for a second and imagine using your smartphone without being able to tap the screen. That's how important those keyboards and keyboard combinations were.&#x20;
