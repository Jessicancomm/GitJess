# Introduction

Thank you [Karen Karaus](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-ux-writing-field-guide-katherine-karaus/) for this inspiration!

* I've been writing screen text for the past eight years as part of my everyday job. Now, that UX tech writing is a career path, that's where I want to be full-time.
* As a lone writer on a development team, I have to figure out how to do anything at any given moment; APIs, marketing documents and/or content, web pages, as well as come up with whatever format fits the information that has to be communicated - right now!&#x20;
* Being a generalist makes me versatile, valuable, and useful on any team at any time. It does not always provide the satisfaction of focusing on building something usable for users. which is the best part of the job.
