# Online Help

For more information about the requirements to achieve certification, please click the following link:  [https://www.madcapsoftware.com/services/certification/how-to-get-mad-certified.aspx](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/services/certification/how-to-get-mad-certified.aspx).

I created a single-source project with two outputs: web and PDF. Then, I uploaded the project to the reviewer for certification in MadCap Flare.&#x20;

## Accessing the Online Help Sample

I have uploaded a zip file of the web output of the help project that helped me achieve Flare certification. This file is named "FlareCert.zip." If you download the zip file, you can extract the files to a folder, and then open the home page.&#x20;

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/FlareCert.zip" %}

### To Download the FlareCert.zip File

1. Scroll down to the bottom of this page.
2. Left-click once on the FlareCert.zip file.
   * In Google Chrome, the zip file automatically downloads to your Downloads folder (or the Downloads Folder selected in your Google Chrome Settings).
   * In Mozilla Firefox, you are prompted to save or download the file. Choose download and select a location on your hard drive.
   * In Microsoft Edge, the zip file is automatically downloaded to your Downloads folder (or the location specified in your Microsoft Edge Downloads settings).

### To Extract the Files

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the FlareCert.zip file.
2. Right-click on the FlareCert.zip file and select the Extract or Extract All option in the tool you use to extract zip files.
3. Choose the location for the extracted files.&#x20;
4. After extraction, a folder named "FlareCert\_Web" appears in the location selected.&#x20;

### To Open the Home Page

1. Open the FlareCert\_Web folder.
2. Click the Default.htm or Default\_CSH.htm page.\

4. Enjoy! I wrote a sample project about planning for DragonCon in Atlanta, which is always an entertaining event.&#x20;

## Why Do I Have to Download the Project?

My original intention was to import the help project into GitBook. However, GitBook does not allow you to import help projects. You can import individual HTML pages but not entire help projects.&#x20;

This was a bit of a blow because I started this portfolio project as a way to test GitBook as an alternative to Flare. The inability to import help projects would make it very difficult to convert large help projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not to let a setback stop me, I corresponded with GitBook Support about importing help projects. Help projects can be imported into GitBook; however, their Support team would have to do it as a special project. They are eager to help, which makes the conversion to GitBook more manageable than I initially thought.
