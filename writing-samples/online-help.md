# Online Help

This page features a downloadable sample of the online help project I created as part of achieving the [MadCap Advanced Developer certification in MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/services/certification/how-to-get-mad-certified.aspx).

I created a single-source project with two outputs: web and PDF. Then, I uploaded the project to the reviewer.&#x20;

The content of the help project focuses on planning for [DragonCon in Atlanta](https://www.dragoncon.org/), which is always highly entertaining.&#x20;

## To Access the Online Help Sample

The "FlareCert.zip" file includes the output of the help project I created in MadCap Flare. Please download the zip file, extract the files to a folder, and then open the home page.&#x20;

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/FlareCert.zip" %}

Complete these steps:

1. Download the zip file: Left-click on the FlareCert.zip file to download it according to your browser's settings.
2. Find the downloaded zip file: Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file.
3. Extract the help files:&#x20;
   1. Right-click on the FlareCert.zip file and select **Extract** or **Extract All** from the context menu.
   2. Choose a location for the extracted files.&#x20;
4. After the extraction is complete, a folder named "FlareCert\_Web" appears in the location selected.&#x20;

### To Open the Home Page

1. Open the FlareCert\_Web folder.
2. Click the **Default.htm** or **Default\_CSH.htm** page.\

4. Enjoy!&#x20;

## Why Do I Have to Download the Project?

My original intention was to import the help project into GitBook. However, GitBook does not allow you to import help projects. You can import individual HTML pages but not entire help projects.&#x20;

This was a bit of a blow because I started this portfolio project as a way to test GitBook as an alternative to Flare. The inability to import help projects would make it very difficult to convert large help projects.
