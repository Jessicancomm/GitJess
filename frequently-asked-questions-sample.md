# Frequently Asked Questions

## What should I write an FAQ about?

The subject is still under investigation.

## Why do people like FAQs?

Usually because they are hoping the content will read their minds and answer the one question they are asking in their minds but can't quite articulate, even to themselves. Basically, people love it when content can read their minds. This is why user research is so valuable; it documents what _actually is_ in their minds.&#x20;
