# UX and Microcopy

As a lone writer on a development team, I have to figure out how to do anything at any given moment; APIs, marketing documents and/or content, web pages, as well as come up with whatever format fits the information that has to be communicated - right now!&#x20;

While it's wonderful to be useful to my team, the best part of this job is providing users with something that helps them in their lives or their jobs. This section is dedicated to the projects I've led or been a part of that provided the most value to both internal and external users.
