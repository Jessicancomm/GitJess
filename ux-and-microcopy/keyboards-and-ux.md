# Keyboards and UX

So, let's talk keyboards. Way back in the day, before smartphones with touchscreens, the only way to enter information was via keyboards and, more specifically, keyboard combinations.&#x20;

Stop for a second and imagine using your smartphone without being able to tap the screen.

It was my job to document the keyboards for end users. After speaking with people in the Quality Assurance and Support departments over time, I realized that the keyboards and their combinations were the most important content in the user documentation.&#x20;

### The Challenge

No one saw the keyboards assembled the way a user would until the first sample devices were manufactured. At this point in the process, making any changes or corrections costed more money and time than was feasible. The device was often on the verge of being released.&#x20;

To document the keyboard combinations, I would receive a 10- to 12-page document from the Engineering department that contained all combinations for all three versions of the keyboard in one table. Sometimes, this information was a text file with comma-separated values.

The expected process was for me to format or reformat the information in a long table. This did not seem like the best way to present such important information, but it was the way it had always been done.&#x20;

Even more troublesome was the fact that no one could really check that the keyboard combinations were correct because no one had a keyboard to look at.&#x20;

### My Solution

I had so much trouble figuring out the keyboard information from those text files that I could barely check my own work! It was clear to me that people needed to see the keyboard as it would be manufactured.&#x20;

Believing that there must be an assembled drawing of the keyboards somewhere, I went hunting and pecking through engineering drawings on the shared drive. The documents in this drive were PDFs with names assigned by the coding system as per ISO9000 guidelines; in other words, not descriptive. Therefore, I had to open each PDF file to see what it contained.&#x20;

Eventually, I found all the keyboard drawings for each keyboard type. As it turned out, there were at least five or six separate drawings for each keyboard offered that were layered on top of each other when manufactured.&#x20;

#### Keyboards Assembled

I assembled the keyboards by reverse engineering the PDFs of the keyboard drawings in Adobe Illustrator. I layered each keyboard drawing on top of each other, aligned them, and then arranged the layers until they appeared as they would to a user when holding the physical device.&#x20;

This had never been done before. Often, QA and Support saw the keyboard for the first time after the first production run.

The challenge here was staying on top of the changes, which were often not announced. I just checked the shared drive for the documents I needed on a regular basis and reassembled the graphics accordingly.

#### Documenting the Keyboards

As my Adobe Illustrator skills developed, I was able to describe each key with an image, which had never been done before either.&#x20;

Later in the document - usually in the Appendix - I included the image of each keyboard, followed by its keyboard combinations.&#x20;

### The Result

My efforts were very well received internally. Having the keyboards as assembled images enabled the Quality Assurance department to perform a visual test of the keyboard combinations far in advance of the first prototype unit.&#x20;

QA and support personnel would print the keyboard pages from the documentation in color and hang them in their cubicles. They would use those images to troubleshoot customer issues when a device with the right keyboard was not available to them.&#x20;

In addition, I was able to catch errors while assembling the keyboard images and report them to the project manager before the assembled images were sent to anyone else.&#x20;

The only downside was that the keyboard images became so popular that I had to reassemble the images quite often, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, those images provided so much value to the team and the user that it was worth the effort.&#x20;
