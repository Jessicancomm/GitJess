# Certified Study Buddies



As the current Vice-President of the Florida chapter of the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org), I am leading a [study group](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home) for the [CPTC Foundation exam](https://www.stc.org/certification/).&#x20;

This involves a lot of reading and preparation for meetings.&#x20;
