  Where Jessica finally gets git...and figures out how to make an online
  portfolio in a new medium while testing out the viability of GitBook for a
  large documentation suite.

# Welcome to GitJess!

This is the welcome page for a portfolio of writing samples designed to cover the breadth and depth of my experience in technical and marketing communication. As of right now, I am planning to include the following:

* An About page where I introduce myself.
* [Procedural writing samples](procedure.md).
* Conceptual writing samples.
* [Frequently Asked Questions sample.](frequently-asked-questions-sample.md)
* An entire help system created in Flare and imported into GitBook.
* Cross-posting with GitHub
* UX Tech Writing projects - Thank you [Karen Karaus](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-ux-writing-field-guide-katherine-karaus/) for this inspiration!
  * I've been writing screen text for the past eight years as part of my everyday job. Now, that UX tech writing is a career path, that's where I want to be full-time.
  * As a lone writer on a development team, I have to figure out how to do anything at any given moment; APIs, marketing documents and/or content, web pages, as well as come up with whatever format fits the information that has to be communicated - right now!&#x20;
  * Being a generalist makes me versatile, valuable, and useful on any team at any time. It does not usually provide the satisfaction of focusing on building something usable and helpful to the user. which is the best part of the job.
  * "Why UX?" probably needs to be a whole separate page in this portfolio.
* Book Reviews
  * UX Books
  * Career Books
* Preparation for becoming a Certified Professional Technical Communicator (CPTC)
  * As the current Vice-President of the Florida chapter of the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org), I am leading a [study group](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home) for the [CPTC Foundation exam](https://www.stc.org/certification/).&#x20;
  * This involves a lot of reading and preparation for meetings.&#x20;
