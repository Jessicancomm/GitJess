# Keyboards and UX

So, let's talk keyboards. Way back in the day, before smartphones and touchscreens, there were physical buttons on mobile devices. Unlike the digital keyboard that pop up and down when you need them, these devices had actual buttons that clicked under your fingers when you pressed them.&#x20;

Without a touch screen, the keyboard combinations were incredibly important. The user had to do perform all functions via those keyboard combinations. Stop for a second and imagine using your smartphone without being able to tap the screen.

It was my job to document the keyboards and the keyboard combinations. After speaking with people in the Quality Assurance and Support departments over time, I realized that the keyboards and their combinations were the most important content in the user documentation.&#x20;

### The Challenge

No one saw the keyboards assembled the way a user would until the first sample devices were manufactured. At this point in the process, making any changes or corrections cost more money and time than was feasible. The device was often close to being released.&#x20;

As far as the documentation process, I would receive a 10 to 12 page document from the Engineering department that contained all combinations for all keyboards in one table. Sometimes, this information was sent as a text file with comma separated values that had to be converted to a table.&#x20;

The expected process was for me to format or reformat the information in a long table and  publish it. This did not seem like the best way to present such important information, but it was the way it was always done.&#x20;

Even more troublesome was the fact that no one could really check that the keyboard combinations were correct because no one had a keyboard to look at.&#x20;

### My Solution

To my mind, we had to see the assembled keyboards before is was manufactured for the first time. I was having so much trouble figuring out the tables from Engineering, that I needed to see the keyboards myself just to check my own work.

Believing that there must be an assembled drawing of the keyboards somewhere, I went hunting and pecking through the engineering drawings on the shared drive. The documents in this drive were PDFs with names assigned by the coding system; in other words, not descriptive. Therefore, I had to open each PDF file to see what it contained.&#x20;

Eventually, I found all the keyboard drawings for each keyboard type. Most product lines offered at least two different keyboard. As it turned out, there were at least five or six separate drawings for each keyboard offered that were layered on top of each other.&#x20;

#### Assembling the Keyboards

I assembled the keyboards by reverse engineering the PDFs of the keyboard drawings in Adobe Illustrator. I layered each keyboard drawing on top of each other, aligned them, and then arranged the layers until they appeared as they would to a user.&#x20;

The challenge here was keeping on top of the changes, which often weren't announced. I just checked the shared drive for the documents I needed on a regular basis and re-assembled when necessary.

#### Documenting the Keyboards

As my Adobe Illustrator skills developed, I was able to describe each key with an image.

Later in the document - usually in the Appendix - I included the image of the keyboard followed by the keyboard combinations specifically for that keyboard.&#x20;

### The Result

My efforts were very well received internally. Having the keyboards as assembled images enabled the Quality Assurance department to perform a visual test of the keyboard combinations far in advance of the first prototype unit.&#x20;

In fact, the testers and support personnel would print the keyboard pages from the documentation in color and hang them in their cubicles. They would use those images to troubleshoot customer issues when a device with the right keyboard was not available to them.&#x20;

In addition, I was able to catch errors while assembling the keyboard images and report them to the project manager before the assembled images were sent to anyone else.&#x20;

The only downside is that the keyboard images became so popular that I had to re-assemble the keyboards on a regular basis. Doing so provided so much value to the team and the user that it was worth the effort.&#x20;
