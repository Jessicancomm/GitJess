# About Me and AI

Technology and tools have changed drastically, but the fundamentals remain the same. When I started, the space bar was often the formatting tool of choice. I can't help but remember all those space markers, line breaks, and paragraph marks when I'm editing markdown files.&#x20;

The technology these days can be so dazzling that we forget to try the low-tech solution first, assuming that it won't work because the technology is just too advanced.&#x20;

Recently, I was trying to figure out how to save markdown files created by Concur to my hard drive. We did not want the markdown files in the project repo itself because it could cause Git problems. When I realized that Concur can only create files in the repo, I was stuck.

I reached out to the lead developer to show him my potential solutions and ask for advice. The ultimate solution was to&#x20;

1. Open Windows Explorer.&#x20;
2. Create a folder named "MarkdownFiles" in the \source\repo folder.
3. Ask Cursor to save the markdown files to the \source\repo\MarkdownFiles folder. &#x20;

The funniest part to me was how many times he had to explain the solution before it clicked. On some level, AI intimidates everyone. I had just assumed that the solution would be complicated or beyond my abilities.&#x20;

As it turned out, it was similar to using Windows Explorer to create "books" in Microsoft Word so many years ago; the kind of trick I'd been using for years in each new tool.

I said to him, "Oh, so we just have to do the stupid thing." He said, "Basically, yes," and we both laughed.

Using this solution, I could now:

1. Create markdown files in Cursor and store them with the project.
2. Use the Preview tool in Cursor to edit the markdown content as needed (and check my edits!).
3. Keep both my local repo and the developer's repo free of issues when merging.

It was the perfect solution, and now I am creating markdown files in the repo.&#x20;
