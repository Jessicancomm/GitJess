# CPTC Certification

As the Vice-President of the Florida chapter of the Society for Technical Communication, I led a [study group](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home) to prepare for the CPTC Foundation exam.&#x20;

## Certified Study Buddies

While mentoring a student for the Florida Society for Technical Communication, the CPTC was starting to gain momentum. I advised my mentee to get certified sooner rather than later because&#x20;

1. She was still accustomed to the study habits required, and&#x20;
2. She would soon be doing more advanced work in the field, which would leave her with little time and even less energy to devote to studying. &#x20;

Her response was that we should form a study group to read and process the material for the CPTC Foundation exam. And that's exactly what we did!&#x20;

We named the group the "Certified Study Buddies" or "CSB" for short. As the CSB, we

* Created a website to attract study buddies and show our work: [https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home)
* Studied the material.
* Ran monthly meetings to discuss each section of the textbook.
* Created notes and flashcards to review the material quickly.&#x20;
* Held each other accountable for learning the material.

Neither of us was able to take the exam before the STC shut down, but the information and study process were a huge boost to our confidence and knowledge of the field.&#x20;
