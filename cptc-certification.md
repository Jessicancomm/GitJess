# CPTC Certification

As the Vice-President of the Florida chapter of the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/), I led a [study group](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home) for the [CPTC Foundation exam](https://www.stc.org/certification/).&#x20;

## Certified Study Buddies

The student I mentored and I started to a study group to read and process the material for the CPTC Foundation exam. We named the group the "Certified Study Buddies" or "CSB" to make it easy.&#x20;

We created a website: [https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home).

We studied the material and help monthly meetings to discuss each section of the textbook.

We created notes and flash cards to review the material quickly.&#x20;
