# CPTC Certification

As the Vice-President of the Florida chapter of the Society for Technical Communication, I led a [study group](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home) to prepare for the CPTC Foundation exam.&#x20;

## Certified Study Buddies

While mentoring a student for the Florida Society for Technical Communication, the CPTC was starting to gain momentum. I advised her to get certified sooner rather than later because&#x20;

1. She was still accustomed to the study habits needed to take classes and earn high marks, and&#x20;
2. She would soon be doing more advanced work in the field, which would leave her with little time and even less energy to study. &#x20;

Her response was to form a study group to read and process the material for the CPTC Foundation exam. And that's exactly what we did. We named the group the "Certified Study Buddies" or "CSB" for short.&#x20;

As the CSB, we

* Created a website to attract study buddies and show our work: [https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home](https://certifiedstudybuddies.github.io/CSB/home)
* Studied the material.
* Ran monthly meetings to discuss each section of the textbook.
* Created notes and flashcards to review the material quickly.&#x20;
* Held each other accountable for learning the material.

Neither of us was able to take the exam before the STC shut down, but the information and study process were a huge boost to our confidence and knowledge of the field.&#x20;
